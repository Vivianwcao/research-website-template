	description: `Hi, my name is Vivian Cao. I‚Äôm a software developer based in Vancouver, 
  BCüçÅ, who loves solving problems and paying attention to the little details.<br /><br />
  I have a diploma in Computer Systems Technology, majoring in Cloud Computing,
  mainly focused on DevOps engineering and AWS configurations. Along the way,
  I‚Äôve built web applications using JavaScript and SQL/NoSQL on different platforms,
  developed Android apps with Dart (Flutter) in Android Studio, and explored algorithms,
  design patterns, and OS concepts in Python, Java, and C.<br /><br /> Recently,
  I completed the Software Engineering Diploma Program at BrainStation,
  where I focused on building full stack web applications using React, Sass, and MySQL/PostgreSQL.
  My projects also involved working with non relational databases like Firestore(Firebase) and
  <a href="https://deckofcardsapi.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none"><i>Deck Of Cards</i></a> REST API,
  which you can see in my latest Capstone project
  <a href="https://blackjackroyalebyvivian.netlify.app" target="_blank" style="color: #991194"><i><b>Blackjack Royale</b></i></a>. I also incorporated MongoDB and serverless functions in my mini project
  <a href="https://simplydonebyvivian.vercel.app" target="_blank" style="color: #991194"><i><b>SimplyDone</b></i></a>, a to-do app.<br /><br />

  Lately, I have been diving into React ES19 hooks, design patterns, optimization techniques,
  and JWT authentication. As someone who enjoys math and algorithms,
  I love thinking back and forth about different mechanisms.
  When there is time, another mini game is definitely on my to do list,
  something similar to
  <a href="https://blackjackroyalebyvivian.netlify.app" target="_blank" style="color: #991194"><i><b>Blackjack Royale</b></i></a> but with more algorithms and calculations.<br /><br />
  Outside of coding, you might catch me lost in thought at a grocery store,
  trying to recall last night‚Äôs coding lesson. üòÖ I also love bakingüç∞, gardeningü™ª, paintingüé®,
  and figure skating. If you have cake recipes, gardening tips, or cool watercolor tricks, let‚Äôs chat.
  I would love to hear about them!‚ù§Ô∏è`,
